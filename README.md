# Psychology Appointment Booking System

A modern React-based web application designed for a psychology clinic, featuring a sleek blue/black dark mode interface that switches to blue/white in light mode, with full Persian (Farsi) and RTL support. This app enables patients to sign up, log in, book appointments, manage their schedules, and complete payments â€” while giving admins control over appointment management.

This project serves as a comprehensive appointment booking platform tailored for psychologists and their patients. Key features include:

- Dark mode (blue & black) and light mode (blue & white) with smooth animations

  3. About Us â€” clinic contact info and psychologistâ€™s resume
- Dynamic calendar UI that:
  - Shows available and unavailable days
  - Allows selecting a day to pick from 5 predefined time slots
  - Marks fully booked days and reserved slots as disabled (lighter font)
- Appointment booking form with a 350-character description field for patients to describe their issues

## ðŸ§© How It Works

- Patients must **log in or sign up** to reserve or manage appointments.
- The calendar provides the following daily time slots to choose from:
  - 7:30 AM â€“ 9:00 AM
  - 10:00 AM â€“ 11:30 AM
  - 2:30 PM â€“ 4:00 PM
  - 5:00 PM â€“ 6:30 PM
  - 7:00 PM â€“ 8:30 PM
- Fully booked slots and days are shown disabled and cannot be selected.
- Upon successful booking, patients can pay and receive a detailed receipt.
- Cancellations made at least 24 hours before the appointment will be refunded.
- Admins can postpone appointments to the following week in case of emergencies.
